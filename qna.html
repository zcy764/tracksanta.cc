            track.easterbunny.cc provides real-time updates on the Easter Bunny's whereabouts every second for the 25 hours that the Easter Bunny is making deliveries. He starts making deliveries west of the international date line, slowly progressing west across the world until returning to Easter Island.

              The Easter Bunny will arrive at your home sometime between 9 PM and 2 AM local time. Make sure that you are asleep when he comes, as if you are not, the Easter Bunny may not be able to deliver your baskets and eggs. <br><br>

If there is no arrival estimate, check the tracker settings to make sure the arrival estimate time is on.

              Since 2019, track.easterbunny.cc has exclusively partnered with the Easter Bunny's helpers to provide an insider look at the Easter Bunny's final preparations for 3 hours before liftoff. During final preparations (also known as pre-tracking), you'll get updates every 5 minutes straight from Easter Island on how the Easter Bunny is preparing for liftoff. <br><br>
              Once final preparations are complete and the Easter Bunny lifts off, the tracker will transition from final preparation mode into tracking mode.

              In 2020, the Easter Bunny visited the islands of Kiribati and Tuvalu first, approximately 10-15 minutes after departure. <br><br>
              About 25 hours later, the Easter Bunny visited the islands of French Polynesia and the Pitcairn Islands before returning home to Easter Island. <br><br>
              Every year, the Easter Bunny usually follows this pattern for the first & last stop, but the specific stops may be different from year to year.

              We use real-time satellite imagery, alongside traditional radar tracking and other modern technologies that allows us to track the Easter Bunny with extremely high accuracy. This allows us to bring you updates on the Easter Bunny's whereabouts every second! <br><br>
              We've continued to upgrade the technology we use so that our tracker can show more of the stops the Easter Bunny makes. For instance, in 2019, we detected about 400 stops, whereas in 2020 we detected about 600 stops. We expect to detect approximately 800-900 stops in 2021 as we continue to upgrade our technology. <br><br>
              We continue to be the most accurate Easter Bunny Tracker on the planet with our highly advanced technology.

              This is a known issue with the Google Maps that we use when the page is zoomed in at higher than 100% zoom level. This issue only affects Chrome and browsers based on Chrome. <br><br>
              Version 5 of track.easterbunny.cc introduces a new setting in the Map Settings category to mitigate the issue, at the expense of a slightly distorted map. You'll see this setting if we detect you're using a browser affected by this known issue. <br><br>
              We're also aware that Firefox on Desktop has a slight issue where the map "warps" when the Easter Bunny moves when the page is zoomed in.

              As we continue to build new features into the tracker, on older devices the tracker may begin to lag and generally be slower. If this is the case, we recommend turning off the bouncing effect for the Easter Bunny, switching your map mode to Street mode, and closing all other apps on your device. <br><br>
              If that isn't doing the trick, you can search for "easter bunny tracker live stream" on YouTube. Almost every stream on YouTube will be streaming track.easterbunny.cc, so see if you can find one you might like! <br><br>
              <b>Note: </b>track.easterbunny.cc is designed to be a lightweight tracker, so this mostly applies to older, low-end devices. Given you're using a modern phone from at least 2014, or a modern laptop from at least 2012, you should have a good experience.

              Yes. The Easter Bunny was able to successfully make all deliveries for Easter 2020 during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as an essential service. <br><br>
              This year, we have received good news that the Easter Bunny has received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, and intends to make all deliveries even with the ongoing pandemic.<br><br>
              Even though the Easter Bunny is vaccinated, the Easter Bunny takes safety seriously (and hopes you do too!). The Easter Bunny will wear a mask during deliveries, wash his hands frequently, and stay socially distanced whenever possible.

              If you're streaming the tracker via an OBS browser window, we recommend clearing out the custom CSS that OBS automatically puts in a browser window. You can do this by right clicking the Browser Source, going to properties, and clearing the field. <br><br>

              You can replace the 125% zoom level with a zoom level you think works best for your stream.

              Yes, but with one big caveat. track.easterbunny.cc is licensed under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license, which requires you to pay your changes forward. If you use our source code, modify it, then release your tracker to the public, you are legally required to make your modified source code available (on GitLab, GitHub, etc) under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license, and document changes made. <br><br>
              The same principle applies if you incorporate the tracker code under a larger system, in that you are required to release the source code for that larger system (exceptions are made for integrating the tracker into a CMS system such as WordPress, Drupal, etc) under GNU AGPL v3.0. If you're confused about if you need to release your larger system's source code, get in touch with us and we can work things out. <br><br>
              We do not give paid exceptions to anyone regarding not releasing modified source code.

              track.easterbunny.cc launched in 2019 with a mission to revolutionize Easter Bunny Tracking. We believed the world deserved better when it came to Easter Bunny Tracking - and wanted to make an Easter Bunny Tracker similar in quality to NORAD & Google's Santa Trackers. <br><br>
              Before 2019, Easter Bunny Tracking was limited to one or two websites that constantly crashed, didn't have live updates, required refreshing to get the latest updates, no moving maps, and seemed to focus more about the experience around Easter Bunny Tracking rather than the tracker itself. <br><br>
              In 2019, we revolutionized Easter Bunny Tracking with track.easterbunny.cc Version 3. For the first time in history, anyone could track the Easter Bunny in real-time, with a moving map, and pre-tracking. We focused heavily on building the logic for a real-time Easter Bunny Tracker, which meant the tracker design was quite barebones (which many of our users pointed out!). Nonetheless, we showed off what was possible with the future of Easter Bunny Tracking. We even got a nice amount of traffic - about 4,000 hits over 28 hours of tracking. <br><br>
              In 2020, we built on the foundation from Version 3, and revolutionized Easter Bunny Tracking again with track.easterbunny.cc Version 4. With a brand new material design, tracker customization that had never been seen before, estimated arrival times for the Easter Bunny, built-in information about the Easter Bunny's stops, enhanced mobile usability, and tons of new features, the future of Easter Bunny Tracking came to life. All these improvements mean we grew by a whopping 850% compared to 2019's run of track.easterbunny.cc, with a total of 35,000 hits and 14,000 unique visitors from around the world. <br><br>
              For 2021, we're focused on making a more refined, customizable, and better tracker with track.easterbunny.cc Version 5. While we're not revolutionizing Easter Bunny Tracking again, we hope you'll enjoy new features such as metric customization, metrics on mobile devices, more accurate Easter Bunny arrival estimates, better stop detection, map customization, better localization, and lots of little changes & features to make the best possible tracking experience. <br><br>
              Although may not be the first nor the biggest Easter Bunny Tracker, we're certainly the best Easter Bunny Tracker on the internet. We constantly innovate year-over-year to create the best tracking experience possible. <br><br>
              We hope that you continue to support track.easterbunny.cc in the coming years!

              If you've watched eastmountainfilms' tracking streams on YouTube, then you know the person who made track.easterbunny.cc! I entered into the tracking community in December 2017 to try and solve a similar problem with Easter Bunny Tracking - the lack of good quality Santa Tracking streams online. <br><br>
              I started with my Santa Tracker 2017 stream which attracted over 120,000 views, continuing that success in 2018 & 2019 with over 250,000 views combined across the three years. <br><br>
              When it came to Easter Bunny Tracking, I was introduced to it after the ST 2017 stream. I was planning to use TheCPTrackers for my 2018 Easter Bunny Tracker stream, but it went down a few weeks before Easter 2018. Track Easter Bunny was the only alternative - and I absolutely hated the site. So, I did what any developer does - I made my own Easter Bunny Tracker. <br><br>
              My 2018 EBT stream used a very hacky custom tracker made with WordPress, but hey, it did the job and worked! Most importantly, it was better than Track Easter Bunny. I wanted to continue down this road of a custom tracker in 2019, making a fully-fledged one with a moving map, which eventually turned into making the custom tracker public, which became track.easterbunny.cc, and the rest is history! <br><br>
              track.easterbunny.cc has been made as one of my independent projects. I've worked on a large chunk of the tracker, alongside members of the East's Tracking Discord who have worked on various aspects of the tracker on their own time. One of the goals of TEBCC (the abbreviation of track.easterbunny.cc) was to make it a good web app using native technologies, and make it compatible on 99% of devices around. This is why you can use track.easterbunny.cc with the Nintendo Switch built-in browser (and it works!!).<br><br>
              I'm incredibly honored to see how far track.easterbunny.cc has already come in just two years of operation - and I can't wait to see how far it goes in the future. I hope you can support the tracker in the future!

              I also care about your privacy, and having ads on track.easterbunny.cc is just another vector for companies to track you around the web and advertise Easter-related stuff to you. I'm very much not about that. <br><br>
              As of now, I'm still looking into ways on reducing costs incurred by track.easterbunny.cc. More information about this will likely come out after Easter 2021, once I have 3 years of usage data.

              Orthodox Easter is a holiday celebrated by Orthodox Christians to celebrate Jesus' resurrection. The date for Orthodox Christian date for Easter generally occurs later than the Easter date observed by western churches, as it is celebrated on the Easter Sunday date in the Julian calendar, compared to the Gregorian calendar for western Easter. <br><br>
              Orthodox Easter celebrate "the miracle of Easter" on the Easter Sunday date in the Julian calendar. Preparations for Orthodox Easter begin with 40 days of strict fasting before Easter Sunday. Additionally, many Orthodox Christians attend liturgies during the Holy Week that leads up to Easter Sunday.

              During the 2020 run of track.easterbunny.cc, we got messages from track.easterbunny.cc users asking if there was going to be a second run for Orthodox Easter. To allow for a separate experience between the two Easters, we decided to make a separate Orthodox Easter Bunny Tracker. <br><br>
              This first run of track.orthodoxbunny.cc is experimental - we're going to see how it works, collect user feedback, and evaluate the long-term strategy going forward.

              Both of the trackers will be virtually the same. We plan to reflect a lower baskets delivered count in track.orthodoxbunny.cc. Since Orthodox Easter has a strong connection to Greece, we plan to show more stops in Greece compared to the normal Easter Bunny Tracker. <br><br>
              We welcome any other suggestions on how we can differentiate the Orthodox Easter Bunny Tracker.

              <b>Note: </b>If you report a bug during tracking, or up to 6 hours before tracking, we won't be able to fix the bug, unless it severely impacts tracker functionality. Bugs reported then will be fixed for the next version of track.easterbunny.cc.
