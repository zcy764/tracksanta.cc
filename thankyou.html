        <hr>
        <p>tracksanta.cc is now officially closed for the off-season, ending our first year of operations. <br>
          In May, we set off to create a tracking experience that you'd never forget, and to say the least, we've accomplished this mission. <br>
          <br>
          During tracking, we registered over idk visits, and a total of over idk requests for site assets. Additionally, we estimated that around 100-200 users joined us for the liftoff of the santa on Dec24. <br>
          <br>
          We can't thank you enough for the incredible support this season. Many months of hard work of preparation from the team were made to ensure that you got the best tracking experience on the internet. <br>
          <br>
          Even though Christmas 2023 now is behind us, we're not resting on our laurels anytime soon. We have planned some massive improvements (dubbed v2) to the site to continue to enhance your experience, while keeping the tracker as lightweight as possible.<br>
          Some of these improvements include improving the UI, adding more customization to the tracker, improving stop & movement detection, better social media presence, and enhancing our site for smaller-screen devices. <br>
          <br>
          The tracker countdown page will open up on Jan 1, 2024, when the bulk of development has finished, and testing begins. Tracking begins on December 24, 2024, at 6 AM EST, with pre-tracking beginning on December 24, 2024, at 1 AM EDT.<br>
          Again, we can't thank you enough for your support this year. It has truly been an absolute pleasure, and we cannot wait to show you what we've got in store for next year. <br>
          <br>
          See you all soon, <br>
